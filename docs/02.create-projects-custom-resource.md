# Create Projects Custom Resource

In this section you'll create a Project Custom Resource.

```shell
kubectl create -f crd/projects-crd.yaml
```

Once created you can see the created CRD

```shell
âžœ kubectl get crd
NAME                          CREATED AT
projects.tutorial.harbur.io   2018-09-28T10:11:05Z
```

## Spec Definition

Project contains `spec.owner` field that is used to grant access of the namespaces to that user.
