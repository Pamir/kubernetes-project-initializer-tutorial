# Initializing Projects

In this section you will create an [InitializerConfiguration](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/extensible-admission-controllers/#configure-initializers-on-the-fly) that initializes Projects:

```shell
kubectl create -f initializer-configurations/project.yaml
```

At this point the Project Initializer is ready to initialize new Projects.

## What Happened

We created an `project` InitializerConfiguration:

```shell
âžœ kubectl get initializerconfiguration
NAME      CREATED AT
project   2018-09-28T14:25:37Z
```
