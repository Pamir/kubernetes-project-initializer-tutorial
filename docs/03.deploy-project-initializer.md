# Deploy The Project Initializer

The Project Initializer is a [Kubernetes Initializer](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/extensible-admission-controllers/#what-are-initializers) that automates the creation of the Project namespaces and grants privileges to the appropriate Users.

## Build

Build the Project Initializer controller:

```shell
./project-initializer/build-container
```

This will build and push the container image to Docker Hub.

## Install

### Create the Project Initializer Deployment

Deploy the `project-initializer` controller:

```shell
➜ kubectl apply -f project-initializer-k8s/
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/add-on-cluster-admin created
serviceaccount/project-initializer created
deployment.apps/project-initializer created
```

## What Happened

A ServiceAccount `project-initializer` was created on `kube-system` namespace and was given `cluster-admin` privileges:

```shell
➜ kubectl get clusterrolebinding -l app=project-initializer
NAME                   AGE
add-on-cluster-admin   1m
➜ kubectl describe clusterrolebinding -l app=project-initializer
Name:         add-on-cluster-admin
Labels:       app=project-initializer
Annotations:  ...
Role:
  Kind:  ClusterRole
  Name:  cluster-admin
Subjects:
  Kind            Name                 Namespace
  ----            ----                 ---------
  ServiceAccount  project-initializer  kube-system
```

Also a deployment `project-initializer` was created on `kube-system` namespace:

```shell
➜ kubectl logs -n kube-system -l app=project-initializer
2018/09/28 14:23:09 using in-cluster configuration
2018/09/28 14:23:09 Starting the Kubernetes project initializer...
2018/09/28 14:23:09 Initializer name set to: project.initializer.kubernetes.io
```
