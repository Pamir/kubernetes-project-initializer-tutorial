# Configure RBAC

In this section you'll create the RBAC roles.

A new role `project-admin` is defined which has the same privileges as `edit` role but can also manage `projects`. [Aggregated ClusterRoles](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/) are used to define the rbac.

```shell
kubectl create -f rbac/
```
