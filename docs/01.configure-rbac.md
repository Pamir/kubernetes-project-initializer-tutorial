# Configure RBAC

In this section you'll create the RBAC roles.

A new ClusterRole `project-admin` is defined which has aggregated privileges of `edit` role and can also manage `projects`. [Aggregated ClusterRoles](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/) are used to define the rbac.

```shell
kubectl create -f rbac/
```

Once created you can see the ClusterRoles defined:

```shell
➜ kubetl get clusterrole -l app=project-initializer
NAME                 AGE
aggregate:projects   1m
project-admin        1m
➜ kubectl describe clusterrole project-admin
  ...

```
